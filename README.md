# Jerome: Your Adaptive Language Learning Partner

Jerome is an interactive language learning web application that transforms traditional, static study into a dynamic, conversational experience. By leveraging the full suite of **Gemini 3** capabilities, Jerome acts not just as a chatbot, but as a personalized tutor that listens, speaks, and evolves alongside the learner.

## Gemini 3: The Core of the Experience

Jerome is built entirely around the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 3 series. The application utilizes the **Multimodal Live API** (`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025`) to provide low-latency, real-time voice interactions, allowing users to practice speaking naturally without the "turn-taking" lag typical of older LLMs. 

Central to the learning loop is **Structured JSON Output**, powered by `gemini-3-flash-preview`. After every session, the model performs deep reasoning to extract vocabulary, detect "mastered" words used naturally by the student, and generate localized summaries. Furthermore, the **Gemini TTS** (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`) engine provides high-fidelity, cheerful audio feedback in the Chat mode. For the "Bridge" feature—which helps users translate a complex thought into the target language—Gemini's rapid translation and usage-tip generation provide a seamless "conversational crutch" that maintains the flow of the session. These features are not merely additions; they are the architectural foundation that enables a truly adaptive, hands-free pedagogical tool.
